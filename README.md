# Identify Customer Segments
Udacity DSND Project 3 : Identify Customer Segments

Project Overview
In this project, I worked with real-life data provided to us by our Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. 
The data here concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. Their main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. 
I used unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, then used those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company.
